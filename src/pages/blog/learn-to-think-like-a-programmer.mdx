If you watched a movie called [The Pursuit of Happyness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pursuit_of_Happyness) you can remember a scene where Chris Gardner(Will Smith) was in a job interview and said this:

> I'm the type of person, if you ask me a question, and I don't know the answer, I'm gonna tell you that I don't know. But I bet you what. I know how to find the answer, and I will find the answer.

Now you can ask me how does that related to think like a programmer? Yes it is here we have two important things **have a question(problem)** and **find the answer(solution)** I think you can agree with that's what programmers are dealing with everyday, problems are always being thrown at them, and your job is to find the solution to those problems, now the purpose of this article is to learn to find the solution of a problem with a mindset of a programmer.

There are four steps to thinking like a developer or find solution to a problem:

1. Identify the problem you need to solve
2. Break the problem down into smaller problems
3. Solve each small problem
4. Assemble your solutions into the final solution.

Giving you the steps only I don't think it's enough let's take a concrete example and go through all of those 4 steps. I built this blog with [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) a Static Site Generator and Server Side Rendering framework built on ReactJS. Recently I was tasked to build an API documentation and we realize that soon or later we gonna need to customize the tool I was using to write the documentation
and then I started to think how I will do that, actually the tool is built on the same principles as the one I'm using to write this article, it is static site generator I got the idea to build a small version of a Static Site Generator by that I will have some understanding of how the tool is working but surely I didn't have any clue of how I can do it. Let's use the steps above and see how we can build something we don't know the solution in first place. I know that it's not an innovation solution but it is a good example to show you how you can tackle any problem and find the answer. Before we can dive into build this application let's first talk about prerequisite you need to follow comfortably. To follow this tutorial I'm expecting you to have basics of Javascript as I'm gonna use **Nodejs**, or if you know another language programming language you can follow along Javascript is not that hard you can understand most of the code we gonna write, or you can implement the fixtures we build here into the language you're comfortable with.

## Identify the problem you need to solve

This is the first step, you need to understand the problem you're solving

> Most hard problems are hard because you donâ€™t understand them

So in our context we already know the problem we want to solve, we want to build a simple static site generator which will helps us to write blog posts in markdown and generate them into html files but depending on the complexity of the application you should spend much time understanding clearly the problem you want to solve, once you do that's a great win.

## Break the problem down into smaller problems

Once you know the problem it is time to break it down into smaller problems, this will make the process of solving your problem easier.

Desmond Tutu once wisely said that

> there is only one way to eat an elephant: a bite at a time.

In our context this means that every problem that seems daunting, overwhelming, and even impossible can be accomplished gradually by taking on just a little at a time.

So let's try to break down our problem into smaller problems, we need to generate html from markdown content, here's the steps we can take to achieve that

-   Get the content from a markdown down file
-   Convert markdown content to html
-   Add html content converted from markdown to html files

<!-- I got the idea to built my little version of a static site generator, I want it to be simple enough, just be able to write posts in markdown and have them generate them into html files. -->

Great, we have smaller problems to work on now let's setup our environment. Make sure you have nodejs installed in your machine or go their [official website](https://nodejs.org/en/) and download it, start by creating folder name it whatever you want I'm gonna name it `ssg`
and I'm using command line interface to create folder and files feel free to do so or use a your graphical user interface

```shell
mkdir ssg
```

go into your folder

```shell
cd ssg
```

When you install nodejs it comes with a package manager called npm so let's use it to initialize our project and install dependencies we gonna in our project in your project folder run the following command

```shell:ssg
npm init -y
```

the command above create a file and name it `package.json` it contains all information related to our project like version, dependencies and more. For now that contains this content

```json:ssg/package.json
{
    "name": "ssg",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "description": "",
    "main": "index.js",
    "scripts": {
        "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
    },
    "keywords": [],
    "author": "",
    "license": "ISC"
}
```

create another folder inside called src and inside it create a file and name it main.ts

```shell:ssg
mkdir src
```

```shell:ssg
cd src
```

```shell:ssg/src
touch main.ts
```
