My passion about programming has a root in watching movies, I liked how a hacker would hack a system in minutes with a mind blowing typing speed. I really wanted to be able to do that, I tried learn touch-typing many times in vain.

<!-- As someone who the first time touched on a computer keyboard at the age of 17 I started to add some self doubt on myself(never do that in any situation) because I was reading many developers in rich countries start learn typing at the very young age.  -->

But recently I join a team of exciting developers most of them were typing in the style touch-typing. You would understand how inspiring this was and I learned in a month something I tried to learn like in 3 years. In this post I'm going to talk about how you can learn it, how touch-typing can make you productive, and how it can keep you healthy especially at your back.

Here we gooo, but first there could be someone who does not understand what is touch typing,
maybe wikipedia can help on that.

> Touch typing (also called touch type or touch keyboarding) is a style of typing. Although the phrase refers to typing without using the sense of sight to find the keysâ€”specifically, a touch typist will know their location on the keyboard through muscle memoryâ€”the term is often used to refer to a specific form of touch typing that involves placing the eight fingers in a horizontal row along the middle of the keyboard (the home row) and having them reach for specific other keys. (Under this usage, typists who do not look at the keyboard but do not use home row either are referred to as hybrid typists.) Both two-handed touch typing and one-handed touch typing are possible.

Okay thank you wikipedia, hope we all are on the same page. Now let's see how you can learn it

-   **First Step**:

    Head on this website [Typing.com](https://www.typing.com/) and make sure to complete all the lessons from beginner to advanced. I recommend you to spend at least **10 minutes everyday**, 10 mins is too small?? Ok, let's say **15 minutes**, the most important thing here is to not over work yourself don't take 2 hours or 1 hour straight, just start small. You will have an opportunity to write that long time. the key part here is to stay consistent if you started with 10 minutes please try to take 10 mins everyday until you finish all lessons. Because you've already adopted an other style of typing you will feel slow while you're typing, don't feel discouraged keep typing especialy don't try writting faster go slowly and let the brain control where your finger move next. Once you finish your practice session continue with your work and typing the way you used to.

-   **Second Step**:

    At this stage you should be able to type all characters on the keyboard without looking at it, now it's time to practice typing the characters accurately and correctly, for this practice, this web application will be great for you [keybr.com](https://www.keybr.com/). I still spend sometime on it.

-   **Third Step**:

    Congratulations !!! ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ you did it. At this stage you should be comfortable with the keyboard, feel like you're a part of the computer. If you want to go far you can also spend some time increasing your speed, the great way to do this practice, is this on app: [nitrotype.com](https://www.nitrotype.com/race) where you can participate in an online car race game by typing, the faster and corretly you type the faster you car be.

I hope you enjoyed reading my very first post on the Internet, I highly encourage to stick on learning because Touch typing helps improve posture and reduce neck pain by keeping one's eyes focused on the display and avoiding a constant need to glance at the keyboard and improve your productivity especially as programmer you spend much time typing. Thank you all be blessed.
