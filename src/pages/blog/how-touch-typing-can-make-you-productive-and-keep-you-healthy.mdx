My passion about programming has a root in watching movies, I liked how a hacker would hack a system in minutes with a mind blowing typing speed I really wanted to be able to do that. I tried learn touch-typing many times in vain, as someone who the first time touched on a computer keyboard at the age of 17 I started to add some self doubt on myself(never do that in any situation) because I was reading many developers in rich countries start learn typing at the very young age. But recently I join a team of exciting developers most of them were touch-typing you would understand how inspiring this was and I learned in a month something I tried to learn like in 3 years. In this post I'm going to talk about how I learned it in a month(If I can, you can too) you can even do it in less time than a month and How I'm productive, healthy especially at my back.

Here we gooo, but first there could be someone who does not understand what is touch typing
maybe wikipedia could help on this.

> Touch typing (also called touch type or touch keyboarding) is a style of typing. Although the phrase refers to typing without using the sense of sight to find the keys—specifically, a touch typist will know their location on the keyboard through muscle memory—the term is often used to refer to a specific form of touch typing that involves placing the eight fingers in a horizontal row along the middle of the keyboard (the home row) and having them reach for specific other keys. (Under this usage, typists who do not look at the keyboard but do not use home row either are referred to as hybrid typists.) Both two-handed touch typing and one-handed touch typing are possible.

Okay thank you wikipedia, hope we all are on the same page. Now let's see how you can learn it

-   **First Step**:

    Head on this website [Typing.com](https://www.typing.com/) and make sure to complete all the lessons from beginner to advanced. I would like you to spend at least _10 minutes everyday_, Ok 10 mins is too small? Ok let's say _15 minutes_ this is important do not over work yourself don't take 2 hours or 1 hour straight, just start small you will have an opportunity to write that long time, the key part here is to stay consistent if you started with 10 minutes please try to take 10 mins everyday until you finish all lessons.
