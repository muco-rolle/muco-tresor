<!-- Intro -->

I've been struggling to find to time to work on my personal site especially writting, and having your site built on a framework that is growing at rapid pace like NextJS it comes with a cost of your site getting obselete in short time, but it good too because it is going to help experiment new stuffs and have a really practice to learn to learn new things. So recently I managed to find to time and update this site and in this post I'm gonna talk some new changes I added to this site hope you learn a thing or two.

<!-- NextJS V10 -->

<!-- Chakra UI v1 -->

<!-- Next MDX Remote -->
