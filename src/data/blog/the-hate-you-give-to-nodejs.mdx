I've lately been learning Elixir to improve my functional programming skills.

_By the way if you need to learn FP(Functional Programming) without the mix of OOP(Object Oriented Programming), Elixir is one of good modern programming language to learn it. Great supportive community around it and a lot of applications to use it_.

Let's back on my study journey, actually when I was learning Elixir I had a chance to use [Phoenix framework](https://www.phoenixframework.org/) (a web development framework written in the functional programming language Elixir) and it is an opinionated fully featured web framework like, Ruby on Rails, Laravel, Django to name a few. Coming from Node.js it was quite different experience I'm used to unopionated micro frameworks like Express.js and I have freinds coming from Python, PHP who tell me they hate Node.js because there's no Fully featured web framework like Laravel or Ruby on Rails I always did not understand that because I'm fully comfortable to glue all the parts by my self and when I started to use to use Phoenix it was quite different experience, starting with a well structured folder structure, well documented and lots of CLIs to automate some tasks, creating controllers, models, db migrations etc. and I started to feel that someone who used to this, it quite obvious to hate Node.js so I guess no more excuses anymore to hate Node.js if that was your case I would like to share with some great Fully featured Node.js frameworks too.

### Server side focused frameworks

-   [AdonisJS](https://adonisjs.com/): A fully featured web framework for Node.js

AdonisJS includes everything you need to create a fully functional web app or an API server. Stop wasting hours in downloading and assembling hundreds of packages together â€” Use AdonisJS and be productive from day one.

_If you ever used Laravel you feel right at home by using Laravel._

-   [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/) A progressive Node.js framework for building efficient, reliable and scalable server-side applications.

Nest (NestJS) is a framework for building efficient, scalable Node.js server-side applications. It uses progressive JavaScript, is built with and fully supports TypeScript (yet still enables developers to code in pure JavaScript) and combines elements of OOP (Object Oriented Programming), FP (Functional Programming), and FRP (Functional Reactive Programming).

### Fronted side focused frameworks

-   [BlitzJS](https://blitzjs.com/): The Fullstack React Framework

Blitz is a batteries-included framework that's inspired by Ruby on Rails, is built on Next.js, and features a "Zero-API" data layer abstraction that eliminates the need for REST/GraphQL.

-   [RedwoodJS](https://redwoodjs.com/): Bringing full-stack to the Jamstack

Do you love the Jamstack philosophy but need a database-backed web app? Want great developer experience and easy scaling? Redwood is here! Built on React, GraphQL, and Prisma, Redwood works with the components and development workflow you love, but with simple conventions and helpers to make your experience even better.

I can't be able to list all frameworks that exists out there but the above ones they all have things in common. In my opinion, using a framework is to be productive and also improve your skills in the technology the framework is built on, by using this framework you will learn a lot from the creators of these frameworks puts it a lots of care and passion from.
