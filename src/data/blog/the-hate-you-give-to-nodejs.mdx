If you've been following or working in the JavaScript ecosystem especialy on the backend side you noticed that there's a preference of unopionated micro frameworks(like Express.js) over opinionated fully featured frameworks, on the other side I have freinds who are coming from the Python, PHP and Ruby communities contrary to the JavaScript communities they have a preference of opinionated fully featured frameworks(like Django, Laravel, Ruby on Rails etc...) every time they try to learn Node.js they all tell me one thing, I like Node.js but the lack of a fully featured framework that give you everything configured made me hate it.

I never understood them because I'm comfortable assembling different packages all by myself, from my beginning of learning backend development that's how I build projects. But lately I've been learning Elixir to improve my functional programming skills and it made me understand why my freinds hate Node.js.

_By the way if you want to learn FP(Functional Programming) with pure a FP programming language, Elixir is one of good modern programming language to learn it, great supportive community around it and it has a lot of applicability to use it_.

Let's back on my Elixir learning adventure, when I was learning it I had a chance to use [Phoenix framework](https://www.phoenixframework.org/) (a web development framework written in Elixir) and it is an opinionated fully featured web framework like, Ruby on Rails, Laravel, and Django to name a few. Coming from Node.js it was quite different experience I was used to unopionated micro frameworks like Express.js where you start your project with a single JavaScript/TypeScript file, install and configure all parts you need by yourself, but with Phoenix you start by installing a CLI(Command Line Interface) app that will help you to generate a well structured folder structure, well documented and it gives a lots of commands to automate different reapeted tasks, a good usage of the **DRY** principle.

Well, in programming you always have to make trade-offs for the technologies you are using, this not to say that you should never use micro frameworks, they have the cons and benefits, but tell you that if you hate Node.js only because there's no fully featured frameworks like the one you are used too you no longer have to, I'm gonna show you some great fromeworks you gonna love in Node.js.

as of to the fully featured frameworks. One benefits of using micro Framework I can name is that it was it will help you understand how these fully featured framework are structured, because you are used to assemble the parts of your project, by the way at the end of the day these frameworks start as low-scope frameworks and they add slowly add new features as needed.

I have freinds coming from Python, PHP who tell me they hate Node.js because there's no Fully featured web framework like Laravel or Ruby on Rails I always did not understand that because I'm fully comfortable to glue all the parts by my self and when I started to use to use Phoenix it was quite different experience, starting with a well structured folder structure, well documented and lots of CLIs to automate some tasks, creating controllers, models, db migrations etc. and I started to feel that someone who used to this, it quite obvious to hate Node.js but today no more excuces to hate Node.js is the only concern is the unopionated micro frameworks, because I'm gonna give some great batteries included frameworks you can try out.

The list below is divided in two parts:

### Server side focused frameworks

-   [AdonisJS](https://adonisjs.com/): A fully featured web framework for Node.js

AdonisJS includes everything you need to create a fully functional web app or an API server. Stop wasting hours in downloading and assembling hundreds of packages together â€” Use AdonisJS and be productive from day one.

_If you ever used Laravel you feel right at home by using Laravel._

-   [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/) A progressive Node.js framework for building efficient, reliable and scalable server-side applications.

Nest (NestJS) is a framework for building efficient, scalable Node.js server-side applications. It uses progressive JavaScript, is built with and fully supports TypeScript (yet still enables developers to code in pure JavaScript) and combines elements of OOP (Object Oriented Programming), FP (Functional Programming), and FRP (Functional Reactive Programming).

### Fronted side focused frameworks

When I first started to learn React the I was stuck many times on how to properly connect my React application with my API

-   [BlitzJS](https://blitzjs.com/): The Fullstack React Framework

Blitz is a batteries-included framework that's inspired by Ruby on Rails, is built on Next.js, and features a "Zero-API" data layer abstraction that eliminates the need for REST/GraphQL.

-   [RedwoodJS](https://redwoodjs.com/): Bringing full-stack to the Jamstack

Do you love the Jamstack philosophy but need a database-backed web app? Want great developer experience and easy scaling? Redwood is here! Built on React, GraphQL, and Prisma, Redwood works with the components and development workflow you love, but with simple conventions and helpers to make your experience even better.

I can't be able to list all frameworks that exists out there but the above ones they all have things in common. In my opinion, using a framework is to be productive and also improve your skills in the technology the framework is built on, by using this framework you will learn a lot from the creators of these frameworks puts it a lots of care and passion from.
