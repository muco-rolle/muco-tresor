If you've been following or working in the JavaScript ecosystem especialy on the backend side you noticed that there's a preference of unopionated micro frameworks(like Express.js) over opinionated fully featured frameworks, and on the other hand if you come from the Python, PHP and Ruby communities contrary to the JavaScript communities you can see that there's a preference of opinionated fully featured frameworks(like Django, Laravel, Ruby on Rails etc...). I have freinds comming from these communities, every time they try to learn Node.js they all tell me one thing, I like Node.js but the lack of a fully featured framework that gives you everything configured made me hate it.

I've never understood them, because I'm comfortable at using this low scoped framework and assembling different packages all by myself, from my beginning of learning backend development that's how I build projects. Lately I've learned Elixir to improve my functional programming skills and it made me understand why my freinds hate Node.js.

_By the way if you want to learn FP(Functional Programming) with a pure FP programming language, Elixir is one of good modern programming language to learn it, great supportive community around it and it has a lot of applicability to use it_.

Let's back on my learning adventure in Elixir, when I was learning it I had a chance to use [Phoenix framework](https://www.phoenixframework.org/) (a web development framework written in Elixir) and it is an opinionated fully featured web framework like, Ruby on Rails, Laravel, and Django to name a few. Coming from Node.js it was quite different experience I was used to unopionated micro frameworks like Express.js where you start your project with a single JavaScript/TypeScript file, install and configure all parts you need by yourself, but with Phoenix you start by installing a CLI(Command Line Interface) app that will help you to generate a well documented folder structure, and it gives a lots of commands to automate different reapeted tasks, a good usage of the **[DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself)** principle. I was excited and productive, I could feel someone who is accustomed to build projects like this, it is going to be hard get comfortable at a low-scoped framework.

I'm primary working in Node.js I had to look for a framework that is like Phoenix and I found a great one that I'm going to share with you and I'm sure that you will love it. Well, in programming you always have to make trade-offs for the technologies you are using, this not to say that you should never use micro frameworks, they have cons and benefits, instead I want to tell you that if you hate Node.js only because there's no fully featured frameworks, you no longer have to.

<!-- as of to the fully featured frameworks. One benefits of using micro Framework I can name is that it was it will help you understand how these fully featured framework are structured, because you are used to assemble the parts of your project, by the way at the end of the day these frameworks start as low-scope frameworks and they add slowly add new features as needed.

I have freinds coming from Python, PHP who tell me they hate Node.js because there's no Fully featured web framework like Laravel or Ruby on Rails I always did not understand that because I'm fully comfortable to glue all the parts by my self and when I started to use to use Phoenix it was quite different experience, starting with a well structured folder structure, well documented and lots of CLIs to automate some tasks, creating controllers, models, db migrations etc. and I started to feel that someone who used to this, it quite obvious to hate Node.js but today no more excuces to hate Node.js is the only concern is the unopionated micro frameworks, because I'm gonna give some great batteries included frameworks you can try out. -->

<!-- I will just write an introduction from their official website if you want to learn more it you just go through their well written documentation: -->

<!-- -   [Server side focused frameworks](/blog/the-hate-you-give-to-nodejs#server-side-focused-frameworks)
-   [Frontend side focused frameworks](/blog/the-hate-you-give-to-nodejs#fronted-side-focused-frameworks) -->

<!-- ## Server side focused frameworks -->

[AdonisJS](https://adonisjs.com/): A fully featured web framework for Node.js

AdonisJS includes everything you need to create a fully functional web app or an API server. Stop wasting hours in downloading and assembling hundreds of packages together â€” Use AdonisJS and be productive from day one.

<!-- You going to feel right at home if you are basicaly working on Laravel, Ruby it will give you the same [MVC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller) pattern you are used to, especialy AdonisJS. -->

<!-- I can't be able to list all frameworks that exists out there but the above ones they all have things in common.  -->

In my opinion, using a framework is to be productive and also improve your skills in the technology the framework is built on, by using AdonisJS you will learn a lot from a well written, well documented source code and from the creators who put a lots of care and passion in.
