If you stop and think about it, the more clean and enjoyable your working environment
is, the more productive you are.

In this article I will help you to setup a minimalistic, clean and beautiful working environment in your Manjaro Gnome.

I presume that you have a fresh installation of Manjaro Gnome but if you are running another Linux distro or you have a different desktop environment which is not Gnome you can still follow, you will find some useful tips that you can also do add in your setup.

Most of the things I'll be showing you here can work in any Linux distro but you will have the exact same setup if the distro installed in your computer is running Gnome desktop environment.

> What I'm sharing here is based on my own experience and preference.

## Configure Your System

The mindset behind most Linux distros is to give you the things you need and at the same time you have possibilities to configure it and make it your own.

The following, is a list of things I do after a clean installation of Manjaro.

### 1. Point to the fastest mirror

Usually the first recommended thing to do is to update your system. Since updating involves downloading packages for me the first thing I do, is to point to the fastest mirror to improve packages download speed.

What is a mirror ?

In the GNU/Linux distro world a mirror is a server that hosts an up to date copy of a distro's software packages, stored in repositories (repos). [Learn more](https://wiki.manjaro.org/index.php/Manjaro_Mirrors)

The mirror servers are typically positioned at a geographically different location from the main server.

Pointing to the fastest mirror simply means to tell your system to download packages from a server that is close to you geographically. Needless to say, download speeds from a physically close server are going to be faster compared to those located on the other side of the globe.

Now to point to the fastest mirror open your terminal and run the following command

`sudo pacman-mirrors --fasttrack`

This process can take a while please wait until it finishes.

### 2. Update Your System

Depending on when the ISO file was downloaded there might be some updates that has been brought to the pre-installed packages, so it is always good to update your system so that you can benefit from new features, security vulnerabilities fixes or performance issues that has been added.

To update your system type the following command in your terminal

`sudo pacman -Syyu`

### 3. Enable SSD TRIM

TRIM is a command that enables the operating system to communicate with the SSD and tells it which data blocks are no longer in use so that it can erase them. Using TRIM can significantly improve the writing speed of the SSD and also boost its longevity.

To enable SSD Trim type the following commands in your terminal

`sudo systemctl enable fstrim.timer && sudo systemctl start fstrim.timer`

Run the following command `sudo systemctl status fstrim.timer` to see if it has successfully started

```bash{3}
● fstrim.timer - Discard unused blocks once a week
     Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/fstrim.timer; enabled; vendor preset: disabled)
     Active: active (waiting) since Wed 2022-05-11 01:47:35 CAT; 1h 8min ago
      Until: Wed 2022-05-11 01:47:35 CAT; 1h 8min ago
    Trigger: Mon 2022-05-16 00:04:10 CAT; 4 days left
   Triggers: ● fstrim.service
       Docs: man:fstrim
```

You can see something like above notice the hightlighted line that means you it is activated.
